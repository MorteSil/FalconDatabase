# FalconDatabase

Library to interact with the Falcon Database Files.

Known Issues: XML Output uses XML Standards for spacing and empty values, source files are different (Hard to do unit tests when the schema is different.. 
Additional testing required to see how the Game reacts to files formatted slightly different--IE, not sure if it is parsing via TextReader.ReadLine() or XMLReader

***** Read Carefully *****
TODO: Initial Refactor complete and all files read correctly. Save Testing is still in progress (See above, unit testing tough without the original XSD documents). DO NOT use your real files.
